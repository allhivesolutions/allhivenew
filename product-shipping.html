                User wishes that the purchased Products be delivered is not within ALL HIVE SOLUTION’s recognised 
                delivery network, ALL HIVE SOLUTION will not be able to process the order further. </p>
                
               <p> 3.3. Prior to making payments on the Platforms for the purchase of Products, the User will be prompted to
                provide a shipping address. While entering shipping address details, the User should ensure to provide

                shall make reasonable endeavours in ensuring that purchased Products are delivered to its Users in a 
                timely manner, delivery may be delayed on account of: </p>

               <p> 3.4.2. unsuitable weather conditions; </p>

                delivery executives or employees of its Logistic Partners behave in a fashion that exudes thorough 
                professionalism, competence and good mannerism. It is expressly clarified that any ill-mannerism,

                a User and ALL HIVE SOLUTION’s delivery executive or an employee of the Logistic Provider will have to be 
                resolved by the User, independently. </p>
                
               <p> 3.6. Upon the successful placing of an order on the Platforms and after ALL HIVE SOLUTION has 
                successfully handed over the purchased Product(s) to its Logistic Partner, the User will receive a unique 
                tracking identity number, which will enable the User in tracking the status of delivery of the purchased 
                Products. The User may use the tracking identity number on the Platforms or the website and/or the mobile 
                application of the Logistic Partner to check the whereabouts of the purchased Product and the estimated 
                time of its delivery. ALL HIVE SOLUTION shall make reasonable attempts in ensuring that the tracking status 
                of the purchased Products is updated in a timely manner. However, ALL HIVE SOLUTION does not guarantee 
                the accuracy of the tracking status since it is updated on a real-time basis and is subject to inconsistencies 
                arising out of time-lags in updating the information and other technicalities beyond ALL HIVE SOLUTION’s 
                control. </p>
                
               <p> 3.7. ALL HIVE SOLUTION reserves the right to charge shipping charges on Products of a value of lower than 
                a specified amount and/or Products, the payment for which is made by way of cash on delivery or any other 
                online mode of payment. If charged, such charges shall not be refunded to the User on cancellations or 
                returns that are made after the shipping of the purchased Products, except in case of a Product having a 
                defect at the time of delivery (for reasons attributable to, and accepted by ALL HIVE SOLUTION after due 
                verification at its sole discretion). Title and risk of loss for all purchased Products shall pass onto the User 
                upon the delivery of the purchased Products to the User. </p>
                
               <p> 3.8. Return and exchange of purchased Products shall be carried out by ALL HIVE SOLUTION’s reverse-
                logistics partners or its own delivery executives. Further details on how Users may process returns and 
                exchanges of purchased Products have been set out under the Return and Refund Policy which may be 
                accessed here.</p>


                <p>Shipping Physical Deliverables
                    Some of the services on All Hive Solution are delivered physically (arts and crafts, collectable items, etc.). 
                    For these types of Gigs, Sellers may decide to add shipping charges. Sellers can add shipping charges for 
                    local shipping (within the same country) and for international shipping (anywhere else).</p>
                    
                  <p>  Gigs that include shipping costs must have physical deliverables sent to Buyers.
                    Shipping costs added to a Gig only pertains to the cost Sellers require to ship physical items to Buyers
                    Important: Buyers who purchase Gigs that require physical delivery, will be asked to provide a shipping 
                    address.</p>
                  <p>  Sellers are responsible for all shipping arrangements once the Buyer provides the shipping address.
                    All Hive Solution does not handle or guarantee shipping, tracking, quality, and condition of items or their 
                    delivery and shall not be responsible or liable for any damages or other problems resulting from shipping.
                    A tracking number is a great way to avoid disputes related to shipping. We require entering the tracking 
                    number if available in the Order Page when delivering your work.
